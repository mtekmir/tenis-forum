A Discussion forum project with a client and a server. 

- Client: React/NextJS/Apollo
- Server: NodeJS/Apollo server

The idea was to implemented features that I was curious about. Such as: 
  - Modular GraphQL schema
  - Sending emails with Sendgrid
  - Admin CMS panel
  - Role based auth
  - WYSIWYG Editor with picture upload
  - Client side image uploads with S3 self signed url
